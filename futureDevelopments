  check performance hit
- speed up the search for same identifier start with 
- add generic "system" that contains a list detectors, sensitive det, materials?
- add cosmic_beam option
- optimize eventaction - too many vector<hitOutput> definitions? Can they br grouped?
- add DEBUG ifdefs for debugging part of code


Code Reorganization:
====================
