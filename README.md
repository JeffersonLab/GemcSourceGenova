<b>GE</b>ant4 <b>M</b>onte-<b>C</b>arlo


<b>gemc</b> is an application based on Geant4 libraries to simulate the passage of particles through matter.

The simulation parameters (geometry, fields, etc) are defined in databases (MYSQL, TXT, GDML, C++ plugins): the same <b>gemc</b> executable can be used for different detectors and experiments.
